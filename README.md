This project is a showcase of what I have learned so far about HTML
It will include use of text, lists, HTML semantics, absolute/relative links, and images
I will also make use of my knowledge of the command line and Git/GitHub!

To take it a step further, I've added some cool CSS.
I also played around with positioning elements.
